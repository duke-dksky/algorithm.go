27 Remove Element
func removeElement(nums []int, val int) int {
}

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
Example 1:
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

26 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
}
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

80 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 2
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
}
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],
Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

66 Plus One
func plusOne(digits []int) []int {
}
Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.
You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Example 2:
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.

118 Pascal's Triangle
func generate(numRows int) [][]int {
}
Input: 5
Output:
[
 [1],
 [1,1],
[1,2,1],
[1,3,3,1],
[1,4,6,4,1]
]

88 Merge Sorted Array
func merge(nums1 []int, m int, nums2 []int, n int)  {
}
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
Note:
The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
Example:
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
